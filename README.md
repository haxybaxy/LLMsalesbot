This project is an electric vehicle salesman chatbot that was created using streamlit and OpenAI API.

This README provides instructions on how to set up a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies for this project.
## Setting up a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment and activate it, follow the steps below. These instructions are for users on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS). Windows users should replace `python3` with `python`.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Installing Dependencies

With your virtual environment active, install the project dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is in the root of your project directory and contains all the necessary packages.

## Conclusion

After following these steps, your Python environment should be set up and ready to run the project. For any additional configurations or setups, refer to the specific sections of this README or other documentation related to the project.
